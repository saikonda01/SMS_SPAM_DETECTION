# Spam Detection using Machine Learning
This project is aimed at building a machine learning model to detect spam messages using various classification algorithms. The dataset used consists of SMS messages labeled as spam or not spam (ham), and the project applies multiple models to classify these messages.

Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a spam detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms. Various models are trained, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and more. The final model is deployed using Streamlit for easy interaction.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of SMS messages classified into two categories:

Spam: Messages that are unsolicited or malicious.
Ham: Normal messages that are not spam.
Data Source
The dataset is available in the dataset/spam.csv file and contains the following columns:

text: The SMS message
target: Label (1 for spam, 0 for ham)
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Download NLTK stopwords:

python
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
Modeling
The following models were used for classification:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Multinomial Naive Bayes
Random Forest
AdaBoost
Gradient Boosting
Each model was evaluated based on accuracy and precision, and the best-performing model was selected for deployment.

Evaluation
The performance of each model was evaluated using metrics like Accuracy and Precision. The final model, Multinomial Naive Bayes, achieved the best balance between accuracy and precision for spam detection.

Deployment
The project has been deployed using Streamlit. You can run the app locally with the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
The app allows users to input new SMS messages and get real-time predictions on whether the message is spam or not.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library
NLTK: Natural Language Processing toolkit
Streamlit: Deployment and web interface
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualization
How to Use
Run the app:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Input a message in the text box provided.
The model will predict whether the message is spam or not spam (ham).
